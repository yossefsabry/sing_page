# JavaScript Sign-In Page

This repository contains the code for a JavaScript sign-in page created by Yossef. The page allows users to either sign in to their existing accounts or create new accounts. It has a responsive design and supports various authentication methods, including email, password, Google, and Facebook.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the page consists of two main sections: the sign-in section and the logo-in section. 

### Sign-In Section

The sign-in section is the default view and prompts users to log in using their personal information. It provides input fields for name, email, and password, along with options to log in with Google or Facebook. Users can submit the form to send their login information.

### Logo-In Section

The logo-in section is an alternate view accessed by clicking the "Sign In" button. It welcomes users back and prompts them to sign in to their existing accounts. This section also includes input fields for email and password, along with options to log in with Google or Facebook. Users can submit the form to send their login information.

## Styling

The CSS styles defined in the `style.css` file provide the page's visual appearance. The code utilizes flexbox layout and media queries to ensure a responsive design across different screen sizes. It includes styling for buttons, input fields, and links, along with transitions and hover effects to enhance user interaction.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code in the `script.js` file adds functionality to the page. It handles the switching between the sign-in and logo-in sections when the corresponding buttons are clicked. By removing and adding CSS classes, it controls the visibility and positioning of the sections. Additionally, the code dynamically changes the background color of the page based on the active section, providing visual feedback to the user.

## External Dependencies

Please note that the code relies on the following external CSS and JavaScript files:

- `all.min.css`: Provides additional styling for the page.
- `normalize.css`: Ensures consistent rendering across different browsers.
- `all.min.js`: Includes additional JavaScript functionality.

Make sure to include these files in your project directory for the code to work correctly.

Feel free to explore and customize the provided code for your own sign-in page needs. Happy coding! ðŸš€
